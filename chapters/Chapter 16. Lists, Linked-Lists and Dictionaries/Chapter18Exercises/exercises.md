# Chapter 18 Exercises

1. Write a program that counts, in a given array of integers, the **number of occurrences of each integer.**

    Example: `array = {3, 4, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4, 3, 2}` 

    | 2 -> 2 times | 3 -> 4 times | 4 -> 3 times |
    |---|---|---|

2. Write a program to remove from a sequence all the integers, which appear **odd number of times.** For instance, for the sequence **{4, 2, 2, 5, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6, 6, 6}** the output would be **{5, 3, 3, 5}.**
3. Write a program that counts **how many times each word** from a given text file `words.txt` appears in it. The result words should be **ordered by their number of occurrences** in the text.
    
    Example: "This is the TEXT. Text, text, text â€“ THIS TEXT! Is this the text?"
    
    Result: is -> 2, the -> 2, this -> 3, text -> 6.
