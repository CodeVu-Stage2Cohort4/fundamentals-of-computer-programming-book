# Chapter 14a Solutions and Guidelines

1. Use `enum` for subjects and universities.
2. To avoid repetition of source code call **constructors** from each other with keyword `this(<parameters>)`.
<!--  -->
4. Display on the console in all fields of the class `Student`, followed by a blank line.
5. Define as `private` all members of the class `Student` and then using Visual Studio (Refactor -> Encapsulate Field) define automatically the public `get / set` methods to access these fields.
6. **Create a few students** and display the whole information for each one of them.

---

8. Declare three separate classes: `Phone`, `Battery` and `Display`.
9. Define the described constructors and **create a test program** to check if classes are working properly.
<!--  -->
12. Override the method `ToString()`.
13. In classes `Phone`, `Battery` and `Display` define suitable `private` fields and generate `get / set`. You can use automatic generation in Visual Studio.
14. Add a method `PrintInfo()` in class `Phone`.
15. Read about the class `List<T>` in Internet. The class `Phone` has to store its conversations in a list of type `List<Call>`.
16. Return as a result the **list of conversations.**
17. Use the built-in methods of the class `List<T>`.
18. Because the **tariff is fixed,** you can easily **calculate the total price** of all calls.
19. **Follow the instructions** directly from the requirements of the task.
