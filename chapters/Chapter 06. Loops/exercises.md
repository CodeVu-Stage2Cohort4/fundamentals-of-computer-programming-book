3. Write a program that reads from the console a series of integers and prints the **smallest** and **largest** of them.
4. Write a program that prints **all possible cards from a standard deck** of cards, without jokers (there are 52 cards: 4 suits of 13 cards).
5. Write a program that reads from the console number N and print the sum of the first N members of the **Fibonacci** sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, â€¦
