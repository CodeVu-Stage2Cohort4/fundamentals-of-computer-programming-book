	Write a program that prints on the console the numbers from 1 to N. The number N should be read from the standard input.
	Write a program that prints on the console the numbers from 1 to N, which are not divisible by 3 and 7 simultaneously. The number N should be read from the standard input.
	Write a program that reads from the console a series of integers and prints the smallest and largest of them.
	Write a program that prints all possible cards from a standard deck of cards, without jokers (there are 52 cards: 4 suits of 13 cards).
	Write a program that reads from the console number N and print the sum of the first N members of the Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, â€¦
	Write a program that calculates N!/K! for given N and K (1<K<N).
	Write a program that calculates N!*K!/(N-K)! for given N and K (1<K<N).
	In combinatorics, the Catalan numbers are calculated by the following formula:  , for n ? 0. Write a program that calculates the nth Catalan number by given n.
	Write a program that for a given integers n and x, calculates the sum:  
	Write a program that reads from the console a positive integer number N (N < 20) and prints a matrix of numbers as on the figures below:
 								N = 3					N = 4
1	2	3
2	3	4
3	4	5
	1	2	3	4
2	3	4	5
3	4	5	6
4	5	6	7

	Write a program that calculates with how many zeroes the factorial of a given number ends. Examples:
N = 10 -> N! = 3628800 -> 2
	N = 20 -> N! = 2432902008176640000 -> 4
	Write a program that converts a given number from decimal to binary notation (numeral system).
	Write a program that converts a given number from binary to decimal notation.
	Write a program that converts a given number from decimal to hexadecimal notation.
	Write a program that converts a given number from hexadecimal to decimal notation.
	Write a program that by a given integer N prints the numbers from 1 to N in random order.
	Write a program that given two numbers finds their greatest common divisor (GCD) and their least common multiple (LCM). You may use the formula LCM(a, b) = |a*b| / GCD(a, b).
	* Write a program that for a given number n, outputs a matrix in the form of a spiral:
1	2	3	4
12	13	14	5
11	16	15	6
10	9	8	7
