# Chapter 05 Solutions and Guidelines

1. Look at the section about if-statements.
1. A multiple of non-zero numbers has a positive product, if the negative multiples are even number. If the count of the negative numbers is odd, the product is negative. If at least one of the numbers is zero, the product is also zero. Use a counter negativeNumbersCount to keep the number of negative numbers. Check each number whether it is negative and change the counter accordingly. If some of the numbers is 0, print "0" as result (the zero has no sign). Otherwise print "+" or "-" depending on the condition (negativeNumbersCount % 2 == 0).
1. Use nested if-statements, first checking the first two numbers then checking the bigger of them with the third.
1. First find the smallest of the three numbers, and then swap it with the first one. Then check if the second is greater than the third number and if yes, swap them too.
Another approach is to check all possible orders of the numbers with a series of if-else checks: a?b?c, a?c?b, b?a?c, b?c?a, c?a?b and c?b?a.
A more complicated and more general solution of this problem is to put the numbers in an array and use the Array.Sort(â€¦) method. You may read about arrays in the chapter "Arrays".
1. Just use a switch statement to check for all possible digits.
1. From math it is known, that a quadratic equation may have one or two real roots or no real roots at all. In order to calculate the real roots of a given quadratic equation, we first calculate the discriminant (D) by the formula: D = b2 - 4ac. If the discriminant is zero, then the quadratic equation has one double real root and it is calculated by the formula:  . If the value of the discriminant is positive, then the equation has two distinct real roots, which are calculated by the formula:  . If the discriminant is negative, the quadratic equation has no real roots.
1. Use nested if statements. You could use the loop structure for, which you could read about in the "Loops" chapter of the book or in Internet.
1. First input a variable, which indicates what type will be the input, i.e. by entering 0 the type is int, by 1 is double and by 2 is string.
1. Use nested if statements or series of 31 comparisons, in order to check all the sums of the 31 subsets of the given numbers (without the empty one). Note that the problem in general (with N numbers) is complex and using loops will not be enough to solve it.
1. Use switch statement or a sequence of if-else constructs and at the end print at the console the calculated points.
1. Use nested switch statements. Pay special attention to the numbers from 0 to 19 and those that end with 0. There are many special cases!
    - You might benefit from using methods to reuse the code you write, because printing a single digit is part of printing a 2-digit number which is part of printing 3-digit number. You may read about methods in the chapter "Methods".
